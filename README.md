# Instructions

**Match 3 or more** of the same symbol to score.

Matched symbols are removed and **new symbols appear from the board's top**.

Any new resulting combinations are also scored.

The more symbols on the same combination, the **more points you earn**.


| Symbols matched | Points Earned |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Less than 6  | 2 points per symbol |
| 7 - 10       | 5 points per symbol |
| More than 10 | **8 points per symbol** |

In each stage, you must **reach a certain score** before the **time ends**.

Each stage increases the target score by **100**.

# How-to Play

You play by swapping two adjacent symbols positions.

- Click and hold on a desired symbol to pick it up.
- Move your cursor to an adjacent symbol.
- Release to make the swap.
  - If the swap doesn't result in a combination, the symbols revert to their places.
